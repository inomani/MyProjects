      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of
      a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
      first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
      of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
      of some one or other of their daughters.

      "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
      Netherfield Park is let at last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told
      me all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bennet made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>You</i> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was invitation enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by
      a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down
      on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted
      with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
      possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
      house by the end of next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is his name?"
